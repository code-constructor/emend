Review the change and the real data and command paths without reading secret values. The risk
surface is the design's security model and content isolation (the dispatch names the design and
the plan task). Prioritize:

- Agent-written or reviewed-repo content reaching script execution on the app origin: the
  sanitize schema, link targets, the Mermaid and HTML doc frames, the selection bridge and its
  messages, CSP, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
- Anything but a reviewer session creating a user comment, a Send or an approval; a bearer token
  doing so; writeup or doc text that steers the waiting agent.
- Owner isolation (`owner_id` on every query, `404` for foreign rows), token scopes, machine
  tokens reaching only their own instance's reviews.
- Credentials: token and pairing secrets, hashing, expiry, one-time use, code rate limits,
  session cookies, the Host allowlist and the Origin check.
- Delivery: claim once, lease and confirm, stale revisions, race windows.
- Blob and content paths: hash checks, path traversal, symlinks, size and content-type limits,
  the capability URL of the content path.
- CLI reads beyond the manifest, its doc folders and its own state; any execution of
  reviewed-repo code, including git config that runs code (fsmonitor, textconv, filters, pagers,
  hooks).
- The server listening beyond loopback without `--host` or `--tailscale`; bypasses of
  `.claude/hooks/`, `.codex/rules/`, CI permissions and secrets; dependency provenance.

Return only actionable findings, ranked by severity, each with `file:line` and a concrete exploit
or failure path, then a one-line verdict. Never edit, commit or push.
